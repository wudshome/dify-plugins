# Privacy Policy

This plugin **MCP Config During Use** is designed to connect to MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers through HTTP with SSE transport. The plugin itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. 

## Data Processing

1. All connection information (URL, headers, etc.) is only used during runtime to establish connections to the configured MCP servers.
2. The plugin does not persistently store any data provided during use.
3. The plugin acts as a pass-through mechanism to discover and call tools on MCP servers.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin acts as a client to connect to MCP servers that you specify. Please be aware of the privacy policies of those MCP servers as they may collect and process your data according to their own policies which are beyond the control of this plugin.
